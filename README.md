## ✨ What is this?

This is a **fully responsive financial portfolio dashboard** I built for a **UI Hackathon** using the [Horizon UI](https://horizon-ui.com) Chakra template as a foundation, then extended it using **AI-generated prompts** to help:

- Structure the project layout
- Auto-generate UI components
- Enhance mobile responsiveness
- Design pages using AI-assisted Figma-to-code logic
- Implement charts, cards, and interactive widgets

## 🧠 AI Prompts I Used

> I used ChatGPT 4 + GitHub Copilot for intelligent prompting like:

- "Build a responsive stock dashboard with portfolio value, gain/loss metrics, and market charts."
- "Make a modal form to add news to the dashboard using Chakra UI."
- "Convert Chakra UI layout into a mobile-first grid structure."
- "Create an accessible, scrollable Nifty 50 stock table with React."

These prompts helped me rapidly develop highly functional UI blocks with clean design, responsive layouts, and dynamic content integration.

## 💻 Pages Built

- **Dashboard** → Portfolio metrics, performance charts, gain/loss cards
- **Portfolio** → Table view of holdings, cash balance, sector allocation pie chart
- **Watchlist** → Dynamic list of saved stocks with add/remove functionality
- **Markets** → Live (or mock) market overview with mini charts and filters

---

## 📱 Mobile First + Fully Responsive

Every page and component is designed mobile-first using Tailwind's `sm`, `md`, and `lg` breakpoints. Cards stack smartly, overflow is hidden, and there are no layout shifts or horizontal scroll issues.

## 📦 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThisIsVedant/BullsEye
cd horizon-ui-chakra
npm install
npm run dev
```
